# Writing poetry with ChatGPT
This example covers the chat completion API by ChatGPT.
First, we set up the API, explore some customizations through model parameters.

The picture below shows a list of available models developed by OpenAi(the last element, "deprecated", is a long list of other models that are no longer available).
